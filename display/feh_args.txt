feh 
-f <> (list of files)
-F (fullscreen)
-Y (hide pointer)
-z (randomize)
-D <int> (slideshow delay)
--auto-rotate (read EXIF data to rotate image appropriately)
-Z (autozoom - if the image is too small)
-x (borderless window)
-p (preload image - ?? essential for this I think, but it won't hold them in memory - rather, it will check unloadable. Has a long startup)
-A "<action>" (%f is the filename, we could, for instance, echo the filename to a file or something. It corresponds to the press of a key, so I need to synthesize that.)
