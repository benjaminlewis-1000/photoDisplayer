ISSUES:

- "is not" person is being treated as an "is" person.
- Date range isn't being passed from sendJSONtoSlideshow.php when it contains a <none> value (launchSlideshow is having issues...)
	-- Solution: sendJSonToSlideshow.py was writing to a file and didn't have permissions. In order to be save, don't directly call any 
	   script that writes a file from server-side PHP code. 
- Make sure to handle months properly; I'm passing them as numbers, now... (single digit 1-9)
- launchSlideshow.php has a hard coded xml file, which breaks it on different OS's.
- Year before/after logic is bad... (maybe? That may have just been my file lock)
- Image removal script chokes on unicode file names (mission/SÃ£o Paulo, for instance). I think the addition to the database is bad. 
- Vision tagging is not actually resizing images, which is bad for large images.
